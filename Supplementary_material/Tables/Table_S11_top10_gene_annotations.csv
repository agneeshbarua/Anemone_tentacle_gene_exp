Is involved in the mTOR nutrient-sensing pathway by directly phosphorylating TSC2 at 'Ser-1798', which potently inhibits TSC2 ability to suppress mTOR signaling, and mediates phosphorylation of RPTOR, which regulates mTORC1 activity and may promote rapamycin-sensitive signaling independently of the PI3K/AKT pathway (PubMed:18722121). Mediates cell survival by phosphorylating the pro-apoptotic proteins BAD and DAPK1 and suppressing their pro-apoptotic function (PubMed:16213824). Promotes the survival of hepatic stellate cells by phosphorylating CEBPB in response to the hepatotoxin carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) (PubMed:18508509, PubMed:18813292). Is involved in cell cycle regulation by phosphorylating the CDK inhibitor CDKN1B, which promotes CDKN1B association with 14-3-3 proteins and prevents its translocation to the nucleus and inhibition of G1 progression (By similarity). In LPS-stimulated dendritic cells, is involved in TLR4-induced macropinocytosis, and in myeloma cells, acts as effector of FGFR3-mediated transformation signaling, after direct phosphorylation at Tyr-529 by FGFR3 (By similarity). Negatively regulates EGF-induced MAPK1/3 phosphorylation via phosphorylation of SOS1 (By similarity). Phosphorylates SOS1 at 'Ser-1134' and 'Ser-1161' that create YWHAB and YWHAE binding sites and which contribute to the negative regulation of MAPK1/3 phosphorylation (By similarity). Phosphorylates EPHA2 at 'Ser-897', the RPS6KA-EPHA2 signaling pathway controls cell migration (PubMed:26158630). Acts as a regulator of osteoblast differentiation by mediating phosphorylation of ATF4, thereby promoting ATF4 transactivation activity (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P18654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10436156, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16213824, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16223362, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17360704, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18722121, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26158630, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8250835, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9770464, ECO:0000303|PubMed:18508509, ECO:0000303|PubMed:18813292}.",cell cycle [GO:0007049]; central nervous system development [GO:0007417]; chemical synaptic transmission [GO:0007268]; intracellular signal transduction [GO:0035556]; negative regulation of apoptotic process [GO:0043066]; negative regulation of cysteine-type endopeptidase activity involved in apoptotic process [GO:0043154]; peptidyl-serine phosphorylation [GO:0018105]; positive regulation of cell differentiation [GO:0045597]; positive regulation of cell growth [GO:0030307]; positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [GO:0045944]; regulation of DNA-templated transcription in response to stress [GO:0043620]; regulation of translation in response to stress [GO:0043555]; response to lipopolysaccharide [GO:0032496]; signal transduction [GO:0007165]; skeletal system development [GO:0001501]; toll-like receptor signaling pathway [GO:0002224]
